It may be the case that you have more than 2 radios.<br>
This extended version of OmniRig allows you to set up 4 radios and change their order so that you can use the extra radios in programs that refer only to the first 2 (Log4OM, WSJT-X, JTDX, etc').<br>

It also let you set a much higher poll interval (up to 1 minute) - This is useful for rigs where there is a clicking noise when CAT is enabled.

Enjoy,<br>
